Revision E:
- Finalization of program.
- Commenting on function pieces
- Table of Contents
- Presentation-ready text files

Revision D:
- Convert any local variables into global for simplified code (if possible)
- Changing the logic of some functions
-- In Particular, change the assignment of structures to their own function.
- Clarifying the purpose of some variables, renaming variables so they make more sense
-- (int i,j,k are currently NOT counting variables in main)
- Resize the limit of MyLibrary.txt and UserInfo.txt from 50 books and 50 users to 1000 books, 30 users

Revision C:
- Modify the main function so that it contains as minimal lines as possible
-- Move any interactions with the system to its own function
-- Call interactions using their own functions (E.G. to add a book, make function addBook())
- Implement the rest of the features of Librarian not yet implemented

Revision B:
- Redo entire code, this time base it on structures Book and User instead of generic Character arrays

Revision A:
- Plan out the logic of the program
-- Main flow of the program:
--- Read text files
--- Store contents into local arrays
--- Log-in
---- Compare the login data with username and password stored in local arrays
--- Interact with the system upon logging in.
---- Determine if the user is a borrower or librarian
--- After interaction is complete, write back to files
---- Read from the arrays and store their content back into the text files
